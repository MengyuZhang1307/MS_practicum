# Causal Inference for N-of-1 Observational Study with State-Space Models

The project “Causal Inference for N-of-1 Observational Study (N1OS) with State-Space Models” is supervised by Dr. Linda Valeri in Biostatistics Department at Columbia University. My responsibility is to find the connection between parameters in state space model and
treatment effect in N1OS by simulations.
